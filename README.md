## Project Overview

This project involves building a neural network to classify images of clothing items from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of 28x28 pixels, each belonging to one of 10 categories of clothing.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing

We begin by loading the Fashion MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set. We normalize the pixel values to be between 0 and 1 and further split the training set into a smaller training set and a validation set.

## Data Visualization

To understand the data better, we visualize some images from the training set along with their labels. We create a grid of images to get an overview of the dataset.

## Model Building

We build a Sequential neural network model using Keras. The model consists of:
- A Flatten layer to convert each 28x28 image into a 1D vector of 784 pixels.
- Two hidden layers with ReLU activation function.
- An output layer with softmax activation to get a probability distribution over the 10 classes.

## Training the Model

We compile the model with the sparse categorical crossentropy loss function, stochastic gradient descent optimizer, and accuracy metric. The model is trained for 30 epochs on the training set and validated on the validation set.

## Evaluating and Making Predictions

The model's performance is evaluated on the test set, and its accuracy and loss are recorded. We also make predictions on a few test images and compare them with the true labels.

## Summary

- Loaded and preprocessed the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- Visualized the dataset to get a better understanding of the data.
- Built a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Trained the model for 30 epochs while monitoring its performance on a validation set.
- Evaluated the model on unseen test data.

The model achieved a test accuracy of approximately **87.7%** with a test loss of ~0.3487, demonstrating that it generalizes well to new data.
